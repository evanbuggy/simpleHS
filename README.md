# Simple Harmony Search
This is a very basic implementation of harmony search in Python. Its goal is to implement the primary principles of HS in a simple fashion.

## Notes
The algorithm assumes that the objective function only takes 2 inputs. It also assumes that it is a minimization problem. The fitness function provided is a logarithmic Rosenbrock's Banana Function.
